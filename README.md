# Exercise-Deep_Learning_Malaria_Dataset

The Malaria dataset contains a total number of 27,558 images of infected and uninfected cells image. A CNN model was trained using transfer learning and the model returns a high accuracy. However, it tooks around two hours to complete the model training for this simple classification due to the size of the dataset.

Therefore, I come up with the idea to train the model with a smaller amount of images and try different method to improve the model preformance. The below method was used and result is compared with the model that train by the entire data set. 
1. Image Data Generator
2. Transfer Learning (VGG16)
