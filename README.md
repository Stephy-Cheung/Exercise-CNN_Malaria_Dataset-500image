# Exercise-Deep_Learning_Malaria_Dataset

The Malaria dataset contains a total number of 27,558 images of infected and uninfected cells image. A CNN model was trained using this dataset with high accuracy. It tooks a 

Therefore, I come up with the idea to train the model with a smaller amount of image and try different method to improve the model preformance. The below method was used and result is compared with the model that train by the entire data set. 
1. Image Data Generator
2. Transfer Learning (VGG16)
